# Manual Testing for "MyGp"


MyGP is a mobile application that allows users to manage their Grameenphone accounts, purchase data plans, recharge their accounts, and more. Manual testing is a crucial part of the software development life cycle for MyGP, as it ensures that the application functions as expected and meets the requirements.

## Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive guide for manual testing of the MyGP application. The document will outline the testing process, test scenarios, and expected results.

## Prerequisites
Understanding of the MyGp. Beacause, here I'm gonna testing, including its features, functionality, and business requirements.

 - Test environment: Operating Systems, Devices, 
 - Test data: Verious type of data.
 - Test plan: Solid Test plan.
 - Test scripts: N/A here
 - Testing tools: N/A
 
 ## Testing Process
The following steps should be followed when performing manual testing for MyGP:

- Understand the requirements and specifications of the application.
- Create test scenarios based on the requirements and specifications.
- Execute the test scenarios on the application.
- Report any defects or issues discovered during testing.
- Retest the application after defects are fixed to ensure that they have been resolved.
 
## Installing
The following software and tools need to be install for the test:

- Browser: Different browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox
- Operating system: Funtouch OS
- Screen recording software: AwesomeScreenshot.
- Bug tracking tool: JIRA.

## Test Scenarios
The following test scenarios should be executed during manual testing of MyGP:

- Verify that the user is able to log in to their account using valid credentials.
- Verify that the user is unable to log in to their account using invalid credentials.
- Verify that the user is able to purchase data plans.
- Verify that the user is able to recharge their account.
- Verify that the user is able to view their account balance.
- Verify that the user is able to view their transaction history.
- Verify that the featues named "near me"
- Verify that the Store Locator function.
- Verify that the application functions as expected when switching between mobile networks.

## Environment Variables

As I mentioned earlier, for manual testing, there may not be specific environment variables that are required to be set up as the testing is performed manually by a human tester. Therefore, the concept of environment variables may not be directly applicable to manual testing.

 - Test environment:Browsers, Operating Systems, Devices, 
 - Test data: Verious type of data.
 - Test plan: Solid Test plan.
 - Test scripts: N/A here
 - Testing tools:JMeter
